Reporting:Reporting:loadReports,
...saveReports
...createReport
...deleteReport
[5:06:52 PM] Aaron Sievers: actually deleteReport is not necessary
[5:07:22 PM] Aaron Sievers: createReport is only to send the name to the server, and get the inserted ID back
[5:07:36 PM] Aaron Sievers: otherwise all you need it loadReports and saveReports
[5:08:24 PM] Aaron Sievers: what i would do is, any time a change is made (drag/drop, delete report, rename, edit) then call saveReports() using a DelayedTask
[5:11:07 PM] Aaron Sievers: do you understand what I mean?
i would be lazy and perform all operations in the UI (add, delete, edit) and then save all data at once
[5:11:45 PM] Aaron Sievers: so you only need to contact the server to create a report so that you will have a unique ID
